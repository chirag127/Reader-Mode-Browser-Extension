# Reader Mode Browser Extension - Project Summary

## Overview

The Reader Mode Browser Extension is a lightweight browser extension that transforms any webpage into a clean, distraction-free reading experience. It extracts the main content from a webpage and presents it in a customizable format optimized for reading.

## Key Features

- **Content Extraction**: Uses advanced algorithms to identify and extract the main content of a webpage
- **Clean Reading UI**: Displays only the essential content (title, article text, images)
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable reading in any environment
- **Font Customization**: Adjustable font family and size for better readability
- **Persistence**: Remembers user preferences for theme, font, and size

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Background Script** (`background.js`): Manages the extension's state and handles communication between components
2. **Content Script** (`content.js`): Extracts content from webpages using Readability.js
3. **Reader UI** (`reader/`): Presents the extracted content in a clean, customizable format
4. **Popup UI** (`popup.html`, `popup.js`): Provides a simple interface for enabling reader mode

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and logic
- **HTML/CSS**: User interface and styling
- **Manifest V3**: Latest extension manifest format for modern browsers
- **Readability.js**: Content extraction algorithm (from Mozilla)

### Browser Compatibility

The extension is designed to work with:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
