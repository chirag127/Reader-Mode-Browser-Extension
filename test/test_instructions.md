## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing, please document:

1. The test case that failed
2. The expected behavior
3. The actual behavior
4. Any error messages (check the browser console)
5. Browser name and version

## Additional Notes

-   The extension uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite for content extraction, which may work differently on various types of web pages.
-   Some complex web pages might not render perfectly in reader mode.
-   JavaScript-heavy pages might have limited functionality in reader mode.
-   Text-to-speech functionality relies on the Web Speech API, which may have different voices available depending on the browser and operating system.
-   The backend server must be running for the Gemini-powered content extraction to work. If the server is not running, the extension will fall back to basic content extraction.
